# HW 1 

Will focus on getting students set up.  The basic structure is the same as DS100 HW1, and the Jupyter Notebook in this directory is a slightly modified version of that.

In place of the image classification section, it might be interesting to have students write a script to pull data from the CAISO website.  See detail in HW draft.
