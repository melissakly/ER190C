    "This HW continues with the world bank stats.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Major goals:**\n",
    "1. Work with different file types\n",
    "2. Merge dataframes and perform operations to add new columns\n",
    "3. View data through lens of structure, granularity, scope, temporality and faithfulness\n",
    "4. Understand how HDI is constructed\n",
    "5. Do some basic data cleaning operations with errors we deliberately introduce into the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Desired outline of this HW:**\n",
    "* First, have students construct HDI on their own.  Process:\n",
    "    1. Prepare Data\n",
    "        * GNI per capita, \n",
    "            * https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.PP.CD. \n",
    "        * health -- life expectancy, http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=WDI&f=Indicator_Code%3ASP.DYN.LE00.IN. \n",
    "            * Country notes [here](http://data.un.org/_Docs/WDIcountries_2016_10_12.pdf)\n",
    "        * education -- \n",
    "            * expected years of schooling: http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/69706\n",
    "            * mean years of schooling: http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/103006\n",
    "        * consider pulling all data to a local location\n",
    "            * with a diversity of file types (xml, csv, tsv, etc)\n",
    "            * with some deliberate errors the students would need to fix\n",
    "    2. **Question**: \n",
    "        * what is the structure, granularity, scope, temporality and faithfulness of the data?\n",
    "            * Scope -- are all countries included?  Within each country can you find information about whether data are derived from a census, random sample, or other?\n",
    "            * Faithfulness: where do the data come from?  Is there any reason to question it?  There is a lot to dig into here.  Have students read about and comment on a few things of their choosing.\n",
    "    3. Classify countries\n",
    "        * put all data into one dataframe\n",
    "        * then write a function that outputs each country's region -- using region tables [here](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/site-content/CLASS.xls)\n",
    "        * create a new column in the df that includes region.\n",
    "        * consider putting the region tables in a local file and change a few contry names so they don't match those in the GNI, health and education data -- students need to find a way to fix the mapping.\n",
    "    * Follow procedure to compute HDI [here](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2016_technical_notes_0.pdf \"UNDP HDI Notes\")\n",
    "        * have students write a function that normalizes each individual metric (GNI, life expectancy, education)\n",
    "            * question: why is it important to normalize these in the HDI?\n",
    "        * add each normalized metric as a new column in the dataframe\n",
    "        * have students write a function that computes the HDI by country and year in the dataset.\n",
    "    * Examine how country rankings for HDI compare to rankings for individual metrics (health, education, income)\n",
    "        * look at top ten and bottom ten in each category and comment.  What does this imply about correlation between these measures?"
