# ER190C HW6
In this homework we'll start working with models that contain a larger number of features.  

We'll work with model selection tools and the application will be land use regresion: Predicting air quality.  Data are based on Novotny et al's paper, in this directory.  For now we focus on their "final model" data set.  In HW9 we'll use the larger data set.
