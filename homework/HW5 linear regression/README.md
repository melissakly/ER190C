# ER190C HW5
In this homework students will start working with air quality data, run k-nearest neighbors and do a simple linear regression.  

We'll use the EPA air pollution measurements again (first used in HW2).  The objective is to build simple prediction models for PM2.5 and Ozone and / or NO2 concentrations versus temperature.  All these data are available at https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html
